## Installation and Setup
Make sure you have Python installed on your local machine. I give the necessary information about the software requirement.

- General Purpose: General purpose packages like `os, pickle, zipfile, IPython, glob, random`
- Data Manipulation: Packages used for handling and importing dataset such as `numpy, pandas`
- Data Visualization: Include Packages like `matplotlib, seaborn`
- Machine Learning: This includes packages that were used to generate the ML model such as `tensorflow, sklearn, librosa`
- Deployment: Package used to create web app `streamlit`


### Data Acquisition

## Future work

- Expand Sound Categories:
Increase the diversity of sound categories. Incorporate more urban sounds, such as construction noises, public transport sounds, and more specific environmental sounds.

- Real-Time Prediction:
Develop a feature that allows users to record and classify sounds in real-time. This could involve integrating with device microphones and providing instant predictions.
