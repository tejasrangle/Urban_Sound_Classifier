# Urban Sound Classifier

ðŸŽ¶ Dive into the heart of the urban soundscape and explore the power of machine learning in recognizing and categorizing everyday sounds. Our Urban Sound Classifier project brings AI to your ears, providing a captivating journey through the symphony of the city.


## Installation and Setup
Make sure you have Python installed on your local machine. I give the necessary information about the software requirement.

- General Purpose: General purpose packages like `os, pickle, zipfile, IPython, glob, random`
- Data Manupulation: Packages used for handling and importing dataset such as `numpy, pandas`
- Data Visualization: Include Packages like `matplotlib, seaborn`
- Machine Learning: This includes packages that were used to generate the ML model such as `tensorflow, sklearn, librosa`
- Deployment: Package used to create web app `streamlit`

## Future work

- Expand Sound Categories:
Increase the diversity of sound categories. Incorporate more urban sounds, such as construction noises, public transport sounds, and more specific environmental sounds.

- Real-Time Prediction:
Develop a feature that allows users to record and classify sounds in real time. This could involve integrating with device microphones and providing instant predictions.
